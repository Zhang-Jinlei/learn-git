# learn git



## 一些学习过程中会问的问题

- origin/main, origin/HEAD vs. origin/bug/fix

  *In your local repo, `HEAD` is used to tell which branch to move when we make a new commit. For a remote repo, `HEAD` is instead used to tell new clones which branch to use as their local `HEAD`. Mostly this is `master`, but it doesn't have to be.*

  [what is the difference between remotes/origin/HEAD and remotes/origin/master ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/4p5p9o/what_is_the_difference_between_remotesoriginhead/)
