## 一些学习过程中会问的问题

- origin/main, origin/HEAD vs. origin/bug/fix

  *In your local repo, `HEAD` is used to tell which branch to move when we make a new commit. For a remote repo, `HEAD` is instead used to tell new clones which branch to use as their local `HEAD`. Mostly this is `master`, but it doesn't have to be.*

  [what is the difference between remotes/origin/HEAD and remotes/origin/master ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/4p5p9o/what_is_the_difference_between_remotesoriginhead/)




先辈David Wheeler大神曾经曰过：

> “All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection（计算机科学领域的任何问题都可以通过增加一个间接的中间层来解决）”
